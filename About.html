<h2>We believe that everyone deserves to have a voice, and that the world is a better place when we listen, share and build community through our stories.</h2>
<br />
<h2>Our values are based on four essential freedoms that define who we are.</h2>

<div id="firstleft">
<h1>Freedom of Expression</h1>
<p>We believe people should be able to speak freely, share opinions, foster open dialogue, and that creative freedom leads to new voices, formats and possibilities.</p>
<div id="secondright">
<h1>Freedom of Information</h1>
<p>We believe everyone should have easy, open access to information and that video is a powerful force for education, building understanding, and documenting world events, big and small.</p>
